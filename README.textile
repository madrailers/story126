h2. About

As seen in haiku poetry, and the rails framework, embracing constraints can unleash your creativity.  story126 imposes the constraint of writing a story in *exactly* 126 characters.  No more.  No less.

This project aims to provide a public interface for submitting stories to the story126 account on twitter.com that does just this.

Why 126 characters?  This is exactly the maximum number of characters that allows a full 140 character re-tweet in Twitter.

This project creates a public front door for anyone to submit 126 character stories to @@story126.  It gives the administrator the tools to approve, and queue stories for release.
